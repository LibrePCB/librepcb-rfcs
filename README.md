# LibrePCB RFCs (Request for Comments)

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow in the
[LibrePCB](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB) and
[librepcb-doc](https://github.com/LibrePCB/librepcb-doc) repositories.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the LibrePCB community.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent
and controlled path for new features, library system changes and so on. We just
open an issue in this repository for every topic to discuss about. It's like a
"forum for librepcb developers" ;)

The RFC process is inspired by the [rust-lang/rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
repository, so you may also want to take a look at it to see how it works.


## When you need to follow this process

You need to follow this process if you intend to make "substantial" changes to
LibrePCB, the library system, file format, API, or the RFC process itself.
Proposing new "non-trivial" features should also be discussed here to decide
about how to implement them in detail.

For bugreports, trivial feature requests, documentation or similar things, you
don't have to follow this process. Just open an issue or pull request on the 
corresponding repository instead.
